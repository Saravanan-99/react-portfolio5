          Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. We'll throw some old
          gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Use what you

          Zip. That easy. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist
          these things. Just let them happen. If we're gonna walk though the
          woods, we need a little path.

          There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. I thought today
          we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the
          woods here. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty
          knife. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the
          wrong thing. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. You
          want your tree to have some character. Make it special.
